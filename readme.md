# Jacall - simple Json Api CALLer mobile app
This app consists of one screen with 2 buttons. Pressing the buttons results in calling https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users api. The results from the api are processed and shown in alerts.

This app is written in Objective-C. Xcode is required to build and run it. Everything is done in code.

The workspace file is the correct file to open, as this app uses cocoapods.

## Main frameworks used

Apple's UIKit is used for the UI. AFNetworking is used for making the GET requests.

## Purpose of the app

Jacall is written to show some of what I've learned writing apps for iOS.
